# Self evaluation

One of the major components of the final mark in this course is collegiality
and participation. As graduate students, the burden for learning increasingly
falls on *YOU* rather than on the instructor. Of course, we're pushing you this
way for a reason: you need to prepare to undertake independent research with a project, thesis, dissertation, or co-op experience. In all of these, you
will be increasingly required to determine your own readings, next steps,
analyses, etc.

With that in mind, this course asks that you undertake some of this as part of
of a group (with the case reports) and contribute meaningfully to the class as
a whole (with presentations and in-class/discussion board participation).


### Instructions

For each of the following prompts, please rate your OWN contributions on a 
scale of:

1. always demonstrated, 
1. mostly demonstrated, with a few exceptions, 
1. often demonstrated
1. rarely demonstrated
1. not demonstrated

Place your score in parentheses immediately before the statement, but after the 1.

**Example**

```
1. Always attends class
```

would become

```
1. (3) Always attends class
```
